## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- #### Java Language & Web Back-end
    It was the first contact with a such heavy OOP Language like Java and also with the web back-end structure. Was forced to learn concepts as SOLID, Inheritance, Superclasses, etc ASAP to deliver the project in this functional state.

- #### MVC Modelling & API REST
    It was also the first experience with the MVC Architecture, making everything work independently in a API REST delivering HTTPS requests to the front-end.   

- #### MongoDB noSQL
    Integrated with MONGODB, I had to learn about non-relational DBA and his connection with the Sprinboot framework.
